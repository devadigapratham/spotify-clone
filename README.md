# spotify-clone

Hey guys, this is the first project I made after taking a couple of courses on youtube. I have used HTML, CSS and JS and made a clone of spotify web version. Its still on progress tho. But for now, I have added only a couple of songs from my playlist.To run the webapp, click on the spotify.html and play the songs that has been provided as of now. Contributions are most welcome :))
